<h1>Exurban Land Use Planning Tools</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Exurban and Land Use Planning Tools is a collection of tools designed to support land use decision making for conservation.  The toolbox includes tools to assist conservationists and landuse planners with desiging landscapes that provide secure living habitat and/or allow movement habitat connectivity for wildife.  </p>
<p>Two general categories of tools are provided.  Policy tools are designed to estimate the potential impact on wildlife resulting from specific land use policy decisions such as establishing density zoning regulations.  Evaluation tools are designed to evaluate existing or proposed landscapes for impacts on wildlife.  Evaluation tools are particularly helpful to allow developers, land use planners, and conservationists to explore the impacts of mulitple scenarios of structure and road placement on widllife.</p><br><p>
